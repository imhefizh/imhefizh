Technology has always been a space where I explore, learn, and experiment. Each project here reflects my curiosity to understand how things work and my drive to build something meaningful, no matter how simple. This profile is not a showcase of perfected skills, but rather a record of ongoing exploration. I believe that growth in technology comes from curiosity, persistence, and sharing, and that is exactly what I aim to capture here.
