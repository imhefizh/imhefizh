### 1. ArcMind [🗁](https://github.com/imhefizh/ArcMind)

Collection of Journals I wrote during my learning, using LaTex for it. I'm planning to make every journal fun to read as much as possible but it would need more time, for now they are just like rough unstructured note from what I found. It's all Indonesian.

### 2. FrontEnd Lab [🗁](https://github.com/imhefizh/FrontEnd-Lab)

It is just my box where I keep my Frontend experiences, most of them are solution for a challenge. Using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No Framework.

### 3. BackEnd Lab [🗁](https://github.com/imhefizh/BackEnd-Lab)

Another box to keep my Backend experiences, complete my understanding as `Fullstack Software Engineer`, also most of them are solution for a challenge I found online. Using Typescript and Python. Gonna learn Go later.

### 4. AI Lab [🗁](https://github.com/imhefizh/AI-Lab)

I'm trying AI models here, making simple app or some interesting app. Using HuggingFace Transformer and IBM Watsonx.

### 5. Database Lab [🗁](https://github.com/imhefizh/Database-Lab)

Here is the place where I keep my personal projects and experiments on Database. Using MySQL.
